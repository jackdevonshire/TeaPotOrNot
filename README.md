# Tea Pot Or Not?
 
As the name suggests, this is a website and API to check if something is a teapot or not. If it's a teapot, the response will be a HTTP 418 "I am a teapot" code.

## Why?
I recently remembered that this easter egg existed, and I decided to look a bit more into it's history... I then landed upon two Github issues with a request to remove the 418 status code from both the Node and Go languages, which rightfully where met with a vicious defence. The only thing people on those issues could complain about was the fact that the code itself is "useless" and takes up valuable space. Hopefully this project will prove that 418 is not a useless status code after all.

I'm also doing this to learn more about machine learning.
